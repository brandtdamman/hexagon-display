## About

H.E.X. Display, or Hexagonal Electronic Xenodochial Display, is a hexagon display constructed of monocolor LEDs.
Due to the architecture differences from modern displays, a custom graphics driver is written.

## Status

The display and graphics driver is currently not started.  Come back sometime during Summer 2021 to see possible updates and a developed roadmap.
