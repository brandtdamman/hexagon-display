## Code of Conduct

Information about this project's [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) can be found in the [.github](.github/) folder.
Alternatively, a general purpose guideline can be found in [my personal repository](https://github.com/brandtdamman/brandtdamman).
As a relative guideline prior to skimming through it, play well with others, be respectful, and facilitate open discussion with open arms.

## Coding Conventions

The coding conventions set here should be fairly quick to become accustomed with after viewing code.
Below is a gist of the conventions used.
When in doubt, aim for readability.

### LANGUAGE

It is unknown what language will be used for this project beyond possibly embedded C.
Wait to contribute until this guide has been updated and a roadmap has been posted. 

### Markdown

All sentences should be on a newline, where possible.
This allows for quick _git diff_ of files and easier reading.
Embedded images or links should remain self-isolated.
While many resources online are helpful and often necessary, summaries are more accepted.
If an external link is required, then an [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org) link must be included as a secondary source.
A Wayback link is waived if related to the purposes of license information or other repositories within GitHub.

## Submitting Code

### Commit Messages

- Keep the first commit line to 50 characters, plus or minus 10 characters
- Emojis are acceptable but generally not used

Make sure to reference any open issue or related documents, where applicable, on following lines.

### Pull Requests

Except in extreme cases, pull requests will generally be reviewed within a fourteen-day window.
Make sure to state all chances and reference any issues and related documents where necessary.

## Remarks

Thank you again and happy coding!
